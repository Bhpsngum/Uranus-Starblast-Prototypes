//compile file for PROTOTYPES

//Why: SP is 6k lines long. That is ridiculous, unwieldy and confusing, and is
//the reason of many bugs. When navigating a 6k lines file, one doesn't think
//"how can i improve this?" - no, one does minimal edits just to get it working.

//That is not acceptable. And thus, i am splitting SP into multiple files. Not
//at all a new idea - people have been doing this since the dawn of computing.
//And yet it took me 3-something months to get to this point. In hindsight,
//i should've done it a long, long time ago.

//How: probably could've reused existing compilers somehow, but nah, fk that.
//Instead, wrote my own node.js script that does the job. It can be improved,
//but it works well enough for now.

//Here goes.
