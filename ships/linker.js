/*Linker

Attaching more reactors to your fighter will make it heavier, less agile and easier
to hit.

That's why you build another fighter, whose sole purpose is to act as an additional
reactor, one that is piloted by a good pilot, is able to dodge enemy fire and
even fire back.

Meet the Linker by Goldman Aerospace. A medium-light fighter with a shitty weapon
and low DPS, yet capable of sharing its reactor's power with nearby teammates.

Said reactor power doesn't have to be directed into teammate's weapons. The ship
can also act as a mediocre healer, sharing its reactor for recharging teammate
shields.
