/*Lobster

The enginers at Goldman Aerospace must've been very bored, when they decided to
design a bunch of fish-like space combat vehicles. They designed a whole lot of
them, and called them Nautic-Series. Two of said fighters have been approved for
participation in Prototypes combat tests.

Lobster is a short-range melee/bomber hybrid. It is a Lobster, after all.

With such unconventional weaponry, its combat strength can't be rated too high.
However, it does feature an interesting ability - it is able to retreat in reverse,
allowing for some interesting maneuvers and improving survivability.
