/*Stinger
Light Mobile Turret

A medium-sized fighter with a powerful reactor, deadly twin pulse weapons,
and horrific abilities.

The ship itself lacks acceleration quite badly, however the turning rate is
exceptional. It features two identical, heavy pulse weapons on its sides,
accomplained by 4 puny rapid-firing blasters.

This ship also features two AOE abilities, that allow it to boost self and
teammates within a small range. Utilizing a unique, recently discovered technology,
it is able to either boost the engines, or boost the DPS and weapon power of ships
in range.
