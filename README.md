STARBLAST PROTOTYPES
Zero mining. Pure combat.

# Compilation

After working on my mod for 3(counting August, 6? i think?) months, i have decided
that working with a 6k lines file is unreasonable and is a waste of time, resources
and effort.

So i wrote a simple tool to compile multiple files into one, and then split SP into
30-something files. This goes to show how complex this mod truly is, and honestly,
now that i am looking at these files, i have no idea how i managed to get this far
working in a single file.

I should've split it a long, long time ago. But "better late than never" is a
reasonable motto - one you would like to avoid when possible, yet can use to
justify your stupidity and/or laziness post-factum. Which is nice.

Anyways. The "compiled" file is prototypes.js. The file with compilation instructions
is prototypes.txt. All other files are logically bound pieces of code, that, when
taped in the right order, produce SP.

# Just in case shit hits the fan

I wanted to write this kind of a... "disclaimer"? for a long time, but keep forgetting
and/or putting it off. Alright, here goes:

If i, due to unforeseen consequences and/or in-real-life bullshit, am no longer
able to develop this mod, i request the people who have read access to this repo
to take over and release the mod. I have only one condition: unless explicitly
stated, please make sure i am really gone, by waiting 2 weeks after my last
interaction/commit/message on discord/reddit. If i don't show any signs of
activity in 2 weeks, i allow, hell i request y'all to publish the mod under
CC 3.0 BY License.

Life's been... kinda rough lately. I fear that one day i will wake up and find
out that my PC/internet connection have been compromised, and i am no longer able
to work on SP.

So... yeah. There's that. Again, 2 weeks of my inactivity => publish the mod.
